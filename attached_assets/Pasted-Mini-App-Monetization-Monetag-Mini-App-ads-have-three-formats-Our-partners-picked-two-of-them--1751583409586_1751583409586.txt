Mini App Monetization
Monetag Mini App ads have three formats. Our partners picked two of them:
* 		Rewarded Interstitial – a full-screen ad that leads to an offer page after a user clicks it. It appears after a user requests to watch an ad to get a reward in return.
* 		Rewarded Popup – almost the same as Rewarded Interstitial, but when a user requests to watch an ad for a reward, they are redirected right to the offer page.
They also tried In-Page Push as an experiment, but it didn’t bring high enough CPM.
All of the formats are added to the task feed, so a user is fully aware that they will see an ad and receive a reward after they watch it. Besides ad watching, the app owners have tasks from their partners: for example, a user needs to try another mini app or subscribe to some channel in Telegram
1. To install SDK  copy this tag    and place it below the <head> tag of your app's source code.

<script src='//libtl.com/sdk.js' data-zone='9524219' data-sdk='show_9524219'></script>

2-   To start displaying ads activate the formats below.

Rewarded Interstitial
Native banner with reward for viewing. Click on it leads to offer page.

Copy this function and call it on any page in your application.



// Rewarded interstitial

show_9524219().then(() => {
    // You need to add your user reward function here, which will be executed after the user watches the ad.
    // For more details, please refer to the detailed instructions.
    alert('You have seen an ad!');
})

       

3-  Rewarded Popup
After click on your element user goes directly to offer page, without banner, and gets a reward.

Copy this function and call it on any page in your application.



// Rewarded Popup

show_9524219('pop').then(() => {
    // user watch ad till the end or close it in interstitial format
    // your code to reward user for rewarded format
}).catch(e => {
    // user get error during playing ad
    // do nothing or whatever you want
})

       

4- In-app Interstitial
Native banner shown according to your timeframe settings. No reward required.

Copy this function and call it on any page in your application.



// In-App Interstitial

show_9524219({
  type: 'inApp',
  inAppSettings: {
    frequency: 2,
    capping: 0.1,
    interval: 30,
    timeout: 5,
    everyPage: false
  }
})

/*
This value is decoded as follows:
- show automatically 2 ads
  within 0.1 hours (6 minutes)
  with a 30-second interval between them
  and a 5-second delay before the first one is shown.
  The last digit, 0, means that the session will be saved when you navigate between pages.
  If you set the last digit as 1, then at any transition between pages,
  the session will be reset, and the ads will start again.
