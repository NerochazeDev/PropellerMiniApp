Got it! Here’s a cleaned-up, professional version of your original Monetag instructions, rewritten specifically to be copy-pasted directly into an AI tool or shared with a developer to build your Telegram Mini App — using only the exact Monetag code and data you were given.

📄 Task: Build Telegram Mini App Using Monetag Ads (Exact Integration)

🔧 Objective:

Build a Telegram Mini App (WebApp) that integrates Monetag Rewarded Ads using the exact SDK, script tag, and ad functions provided by Monetag. The app must include two ad formats:
	1.	Rewarded Interstitial
	2.	Rewarded Popup

Do not include In-Page Push or In-App Interstitial in the UI.

📌 Integration Instructions (As Provided by Monetag)

✅ 1. Install the SDK

Add this tag right below the <head> tag of the HTML page:

<script src='//libtl.com/sdk.js' data-zone='9524219' data-sdk='show_9524219'></script>

✅ 2. Implement Ad Formats

📺 Rewarded Interstitial

Full-screen ad with a banner. User sees banner, clicks it, and goes to an offer page. User should be rewarded after watching the ad.

Paste this code anywhere in the Mini App and call the function when a user clicks a button:

// Rewarded interstitial
show_9524219().then(() => {
    // You need to add your user reward function here, which will be executed after the user watches the ad.
    // For more details, please refer to the detailed instructions.
    alert('You have seen an ad!');
})

⚡ Rewarded Popup

When user clicks the ad button, they’re redirected directly to the offer page (no banner shown). They get the reward after watching.

Paste this code anywhere in the app and call it from a second button:

// Rewarded Popup
show_9524219('pop').then(() => {
    // user watch ad till the end or close it in interstitial format
    // your code to reward user for rewarded format
}).catch(e => {
    // user get error during playing ad
    // do nothing or whatever you want
})

❌ No need to include this format:

// In-App Interstitial
show_9524219({
  type: 'inApp',
  inAppSettings: {
    frequency: 2,
    capping: 0.1,
    interval: 30,
    timeout: 5,
    everyPage: false
  }
})

	In-Page Push was tested but did not deliver high enough CPM. Do not include it.

🧠 UX Guidelines
	•	Show two buttons:
	1.	“Watch Ad (Rewarded Interstitial)”
	2.	“Watch Ad (Rewarded Popup)”
	•	When the user finishes watching the ad (promise is resolved), show an alert or message:
✅ You watched the ad. Reward granted!
	•	Also send a message back to the Telegram bot using:

Telegram.WebApp.sendData('reward_granted');



This allows the Telegram bot to reward the user (e.g. coins, unlock features, etc).

📲 Telegram Integration
	•	Call Telegram.WebApp.ready() when the page loads.
	•	Use Telegram.WebApp.sendData() to send reward info back to the bot.

✅ Summary of What to Build
	•	1 HTML + JS page (Mini App)
	•	Uses Monetag SDK zone 9524219
	•	Implements both Rewarded Interstitial and Rewarded Popup
	•	On ad complete, shows confirmation + sends reward_granted back to Telegram
	•	Clean, mobile-friendly layout
