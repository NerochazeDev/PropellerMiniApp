# PropellerAds Telegram Mini App

## Overview

This is a Telegram Mini App built with React and Express that integrates Monetag SDK for rewarded advertising. The application allows users to watch ads through two different formats (Rewarded Interstitial and Rewarded Popup) and earn realistic rewards ($0.001-$0.003 per ad). Features include USDT TRC20 crypto withdrawals, 5% referral commission system, and comprehensive earnings tracking. The app is designed to run as a WebApp within Telegram's ecosystem.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives with custom shadcn/ui components

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Storage**: In-memory storage for development (can be extended to PostgreSQL)
- **Build Tool**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for backend

### Key Components

1. **Monetag SDK Integration**
   - Integrated via script tag in HTML head
   - Two ad formats: Rewarded Interstitial and Rewarded Popup
   - Uses zone ID 9524219 for ad serving
   - Implements reward system after ad completion

2. **Telegram WebApp Integration**
   - Telegram WebApp SDK for native integration
   - Theme synchronization with Telegram app
   - Data communication with Telegram bot via sendData

3. **UI Components**
   - `AdButton`: Handles ad interaction for both formats
   - `StatusCard`: Displays user rewards and statistics
   - `MessageCard`: Shows loading, success, and error states
   - Complete shadcn/ui component library

4. **Custom Hooks**

   - `useIsMobile`: Responsive design utilities

## Data Flow

2. `useMonetag` hook calls appropriate SDK function
3. Monetag SDK handles ad display and user interaction
4. On completion, reward is granted and state updated
5. Success/error messages displayed via `MessageCard`
6. Telegram bot receives notification via `sendData`
